## PS5 Lua Loader

Fork of [remote_lua_loader](https://github.com/shahrilnet/remote_lua_loader)

Automatically loads UMTX, ELF Loader, and your ELF payloads.
Supports PS5 firmware up to 7.61.

## How to use
* Create a directory named `ps5_lua_loader`.
* Inside this directory, place your ELF payloads and an `autoload.txt` file.
    * In `autoload.txt`, list the ELF filenames you want to load (one per line).  
      Filenames are case-sensitive - make sure the names exactly match your ELF files.
    * You can add lines like `!1000` to make the loader wait 1000ms before sending the next payload.
* Put the `ps5_lua_loader` directory in one of these locations:
    * In the root of a USB drive
    * In the internal drive at `/data/ps5_lua_loader`
    * In the game’s savedata folder
* Import savedata to your game:  
  Follow the steps in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) to prepare and import the savedata for your Lua-compatible game.
