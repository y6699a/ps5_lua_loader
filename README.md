## Remote Lua Loader

Remote lua loader for PS4 and PS5, based on gezine's [finding](https://github.com/Gezine/ArtemisLuaLoader/) that allows games built with Artemis engine to load arbitrary lua file. The loader is not firmware dependant, and has been successfully tested on PS5 Pro 10.20.  
Currently this loader is specific for the following list of games:
1. Raspberry Cube (CUSA16074)
2. Aibeya (CUSA17068)
3. Hamidashi Creative (CUSA27389)
4. Hamidashi Creative Demo (CUSA27390) - Requires latest firmware to download from PSN
5. Aikagi Kimi to Issho ni Pack (CUSA16229)

### Usage on jailbroken PS4 with disc version

1. Play the game for a while until you can create save data
2. Use Apollo Save Tool to export decrypted save data to USB drive
3. Copy and paste all files from savedata into USB drive (x:\PS4\APOLLO\id_{YOUR_GAME_CUSA_ID}_savedata), overwriting currently existing save data
4. Make sure that `PLATFORM` variable on top of inject.lua is set appropriately
5. Use Apollo Save Tool to import the new save data from USB drive
6. Run the game and check if there is a popup from lua loader
7. Use send_lua.py to send lua file to the loader

If you have a jailbroken PS5 with a non activated account, you can use OffAct from https://github.com/ps5-payload-dev/websrv/releases to offline activate the account and transfer save data with matching account ID using FTP.

### Usage on PS5/PS5 Slim/PS5 Pro

#### Requirements:
1. PSN-activated PS5/PS5 Slim/PS5 Pro. Can be non-recent offline firmware if was activated in the past.
2. A Jailbroken PS4 on a firmware version that is earlier or equivilant to the PS5/PS5 Slim/PS5 Pro. Refer to this [table](https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps5/Build_Strings). For example, PS4 9.00 can be used to create save game for PS5 >=4.00 but not below that.

#### Steps:
1. Find your logged-in PSN account id on the PS5/PS5 Slim/PS5 Pro. Either by going to the PlayStation settings or by using [this website](https://psn.flipscreen.games/).
2. Take your account ID number (~19 characters long, for PSPlay) and convert it to hex using [this website](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html).

#### JB PS4 -
3. Play the game for a while until you can create save data.
4. Connect a USB disk to the PS4.
5. Use Apollo Save Tool to export decrypted save data to USB drive.
6. Make sure that PLATFORM variable on top of inject.lua is set appropriately
7. Copy and paste all files from savedata into USB drive (x:\PS4\APOLLO\id_{YOUR_GAME_CUSA_ID}_savedata), overwriting currently existing save data.
8. Create new fake offline account.
9. Use Apollo Save Tool to activate the new fake account using the converted hex account ID from step 2.
10. Switch to the activated fake account.
11. Import savedata from USB drive using Apollo Save Tool. (`USB Saves -> Select the game -> Copy save game -> Copy to HDD`)
12. Use the PS4 settings menu to export the encrypted save data to the USB drive. (`Settings -> Application Saved Data Management -> Saved Data in System Storage -> Copy to USB Storage Device`)
