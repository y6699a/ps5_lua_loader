Use `send_lua.py` to communicate with the loader

### Payloads

1. `hello_world.lua` - Prints basic information back from the game process - its process id, the base of the eboot, libc and libkernel.
2. `sigsegv_crash_trigger.lua` - Triggers two SIGSEGV crashes in succession that should be signal handled without crashing the game process.
3. `notification_popup.lua` - Triggers a notification popup with 'Hello World' on the PlayStation.
4. `sigbus_crash_trigger.lua` - Triggers a SIGBUS crash that should be signal handled without crashing the game process.
5. `streaming_output.lua` - Prints basic information and trigger two SIGSEGV crashes in the middle, to demonstrate how streaming real-time output works.
6. `ftp_server.lua` - Runs an FTP server on port 1337 that allows browsing the filesystem as seen by the game process (e.g. limited filesystem), and also upload and download files.
7. `threading_test.lua` - Provides examples on how to run lua code in new threads.

To verify concurrent (thread) execution: First, run `threading_test.lua` which simulates a long-running task. Then, from a separate window, immediately run any test payload (#1-#5). The second payload should complete without being blocked by the first task.
 
### Commands

1. `--disable-thread` - Disables the option to run payloads in a new thread.
2. `--enable-thread` - Enables the option to run payloads in a new thread.
